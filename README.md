A blood bank collects blood donations, stores then uses them to save lives. The proposed system uses Cloud Computing to provide an online cloud-based blood bank system. Users of the system can view information on blood donors and hospitals. Cloud service helps with improving the availability and fast access of donorsâ€™ data. Thus, in emergencies, users can access the data from their devices at any time. Donors can find the locations where their blood type is needed. The system provides immediate access to donating data. It provides location tracking of wanted blood types and communication through the admin. It manages blood provision, lists of hospitals, clinics, and donors.
